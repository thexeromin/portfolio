Welcome to my new portfolio and blog!

As a developer, there is almost a ritualistic obligation to title the first post **"Hello World"**, so here we are.

## Why I built this

I wanted a space that felt like _me_—minimal, fast, and completely under my control. I designed this site from scratch in **Figma** and built it using:

- **Astro** for performance.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.

## What to expect

I plan to use this space to document my journey in software engineering. You can expect posts about:

1.  **Low-level programming** (C, systems, and networking).
2.  **Web development** (building efficient, modern interfaces).
3.  **Project updates** (deep dives into tools like _Kuan_ and _Termzic_).

Thanks for stopping by.
