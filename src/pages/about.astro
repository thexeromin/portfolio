<Layout title="About Me" description="About me page">
  <p class="font-ibm-plex text-ice">
    I’m Abhijit, a full-stack developer with a strong interest in building
    reliable and scalable software. I enjoy working across the stack and care
    deeply about code quality, performance, and long-term maintainability.
  </p>

  <p class="font-ibm-plex text-ice mt-4">
    I’m particularly interested in system internals and low-level concepts, as
    understanding how things work beneath the surface helps me write better
    software at higher levels. I prefer simple, well-reasoned solutions over
    unnecessary complexity.
  </p>

  <p class="font-ibm-plex text-ice mt-4">
    Through this portfolio and blog, I share my work, technical explorations,
    and lessons learned while building and debugging real systems. Writing helps
    me clarify my thinking and document insights that may be useful to other
    engineers.
  </p>

  <p class="font-ibm-plex text-ice mt-4">
    My long-term goal is to grow into a software engineer who combines strong
    practical skills with a solid understanding of system fundamentals.
